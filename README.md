# Inventory-App

Project Purpose: This CRUD inventory application was built as part of The Odin Project curriculum to practice full-stack development. The focus was on implementing PostgreSQL for database operations (creating, reading, updating, and deleting product entries) and personally experimenting with Bootstrap for styling.

Stack: Nodejs, Express, EJS, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL
